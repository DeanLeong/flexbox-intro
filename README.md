# Responsive Design & Flexbox!!

### Learning Objectives
- Describe responsive design
- Understand the differences between adaptive techniques and responsive design patterns
- Define the flexible box module (flexbox!)
- Give an example of a problem solved by flexbox
- Contrast flex containers and flex items
- Use flexbox to solve common design problems without using hacks

# What is responsive design?

- Talk a little bit about the frank chimero article
    - The concept of "flux" -- a website's presentation necessarily changes based on what it's viewed on. _this is a feature, not a bug._ it allows us to predict the user's priorities and meet them.
    - a screen isn't just what shows up in the browser window. it's an endless surface extending infinitely in all directions. (bring up some of the game projects that had infinite scrolling)
    - "an edgeless surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment."
    - The job of a designer or developer is to structure a page so that at any given moment, no matter the size of the screen or the device of the user, the user is seeing precisely the information they need most.
    - A handy way to think about this is to consider media queries not in terms of "breakpoints" but in terms of "points of reassembly" -- go back to the definition above.
- The difference between responsive and adaptive design
    - adaptive design is just adapting an existing design to a different screen size. responsive design is anticipating the user's needs and creating a design that meets them no matter how the design is viewed.
- Walk through a couple of the [responsive design patterns](https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html)

# Intro to flexbox!

- Talk a little bit about the history of flexbox, why it exists, etc

### Flex context vs block context

- Up to this point we've been working with the block context -- `display: block;`. This means that in order to position things, we needed to float them, use clearfix, etc.
- Flexbox introduces a new context: `display: flex;`.
- Elements with `display: flex;` have, largely, an external block context -- they exist in the document flow like any other kind of element.
- Internally, they create a new type of context that has its own properties.

## Flex containers and flex items

### A flex _container_ is an element that creates a flex context.

#### Follow along in âœ¨ [this codepen!](https://codepen.io/jlr7245/pen/rmxKgL?editors=1100) âœ¨

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers): 

> A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout. For example, floats do not intrude into the flex container ... Flex containers form a containing block for their contents exactly like block containers do.

The flex context works a little differently from the ordinary block context that is the default of the document flow. A number of properties are different or do not apply.

- `float` and `clear` don't have any effect on flex items
- `vertical-align` has no effect on a flex item
- Some pseudoelements, like `::first-line` and `::first-letter`, don't apply to flex containers.

### A flex _item_ is an element that exists within a flex context.

#### Keep following along in âœ¨ [this codepen!](https://codepen.io/jlr7245/pen/rmxKgL?editors=1100) âœ¨

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items): 

> Each in-flow child of a flex container becomes a flex item, and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item. 

### Nesting flex contexts within flex contexts (flexception....?? )

#### Follow along in âœ¨ [this new codepen!](https://codepen.io/jlr7245/pen/pPgZwb?editors=1100) âœ¨

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items): 

> A flex item establishes a new formatting context for its contents. The type of this formatting context is determined by its display value, as usual. However, flex items themselves are flex-level boxes, not block-level boxes: they participate in their containerâ€™s flex formatting context, not in a block formatting context.

## Flex Properties and Axes (axises? axes?)

There's a long list of CSS properties that are specific to either flex containers or flex items. We'll go through a few of them, and then you'll get practice with the rest during lab.

### Main Axis, Cross Axis

A lot of the power in flexbox comes from the ability to switch which axis is which with just one property.

### ðŸ“š Flex Container Properties

([Taken largely from CSSTricks complete guide to flexbox.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

<dl>
  <dt><code>display</code></dt>
  <dd>In order to create a flex context, you must declare it using <code>display: flex;</code>. (Note: You may also occasionally see <code>display: inline-flex;</code> but I have not had to use this. If you want to know what it does, I encourage you to mess around.)</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-direction</code></dt>
  <dd><code>flex-direction</code> establishes which axis is the main axis and which is the cross axis. The possible values are <code>row</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code>, and <code>column-reverse</code>. The behavior of other properties are dependent on <code>flex-direction</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-wrap</code></dt>
  <dd>By default, flex items all try to fit into one line. <code>flex-wrap</code> changes this behavior, allowing items to wrap to new lines. The possible values are <code>nowrap</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>wrap-reverse</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-flow</code></dt>
  <dd>A shorthand property for <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code>. The default value is <code>row nowrap</code>. There's a bunch of different possible values -- essentially, pick one <code>flex-direction</code> value and one <code>flex-wrap</code> value and combine them.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>justify-content</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the alignment and spacing along the main axis, and helps distribute extra, leftover free space. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>. <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-6' target='_blank'>See CSS Tricks article for reference</a>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>align-items</code></dt>
  <dd><code>align-items</code> describes how flex items are placed relative to the flex container. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), and <code>baseline</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>align-content</code></dt>
  <dd>This aligns a flex container's lines when there's extra space on the cross axis. The available values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>. <b>NOTE!</b> This property has no effect unless there's more than one line of flex items.  </dd>

## Lab 1: âœ¨ [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)!

For this lab, you'll be getting more acquainted with the flex properties, and applying them to flex items and flex containers. Hit the link above and start helping the frogs find their lilypads! (Feel free to work in pairs or groups!!)

# Why use flexbox?

### Holy Grail layout

- We do holy grail layout together in class

### Other applications

- Walk through healthify CSS?

## Lab 2: 

I still need to come up with this one but it will be a problem similar to holy grail. [here's a possible lab repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/css-airbnb)
